# DEC
A simple terminal program simulating Double-Error Correction using Hamming code

## Description
This program implements Double-Error Detection and Correction, but it also works for Single Bit Errors.

## How to use

Write a message of choice in the *message* file. An *encoded* file will be produced, where the encoded message will be represented in binary form. There, you can simulate a transmission error by changing up to 2 bits out of every 8. Finally, a *decoded* file will appear, containing the original message.
